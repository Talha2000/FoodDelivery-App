## Description

FeastBud is a personalized meal planning app designed to help users discover new recipes, plan their meals, and track dietary preferances. With an intuitive interface, FeastBud simplifies meal prep by providing shopping lists, recipe instructions, and nutritional insights, making healthy eating both accessible and enjoyable. Essentially, my idea is to combine some concepts of HelloFresh and UberEats where users can create meal plans and have a shopping list ready to order.

Currently, FeastBud utilizes a Kaggle dataset to streamline the data collection process, ensuring that during development, there is enough data to design and implement features critical for the users. In the future, I plan on expanding the data collection through a series of data engineering projects which include web scraping, gathering real-time data from various recipe sits to keep the app's content fresh and diverse. Furthermore, I also plan on incorportrating AI-powered recommendations using an LLM to better understance user preferences and generate personalized meal suggestions.

- Some of the planned key features include:

  - Personalized recipes tailored to user preferences.
  - Dietary restriction filters (vegetarian, gluten-free).
  - Shopping lists and recipe instructions.
  - Nutritional analysis for meal plans and individual recipes.
  - Meal prep scheduling and reminders.
  - User feedback option to improve user experience and features.
